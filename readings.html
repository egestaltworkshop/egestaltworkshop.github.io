			<h2>Pointing out, verbatim.... </h2>
                        <p>by S. Montalvo</p>
                        <p>Currently I am working on two items, the <a href="verbatim.html"><b>Gestalt Therapy Verbatim</b></a>, a   document which is really an handful of facts, lab facts, so valuable certainly, more than a building of concepts as any of us could figure out when starting to read on psychotherapy in particular; and <a href="UC.html"><b>Ultimate Computing</b></a> by S. Hameroff, a fascinating report on, as I would describe this connection, how-to the contact-withdrawal, or the cycle of experience &mdash;as fact, rather than a drawing up diagram for learning purposes as it is wider known, could being occurring at the nanoscale in the animal brain.</p>
                        <img src="/run/media/txarly/gallery/egestaltworkshop/images/FP11.jpg" class="" alt="Fritz" style="width:400px;" />
			<p>Of course this selection is not done at random, I am strongly persuaded that the Perls gestalt outlook itself, is the earlier stage of a psychology which roots in physics, though eventually, behavior patterns observed were pointed out mediated by certain philosophical constructions prevailing at the time he was working, in lack of an own language and in finding of one by a cutting edge highlighting of boundaries. Let's consider his criticism and usage at once of concept names which are of common use in, namely Buber, Husserl or Heidegger when trying to produce his concepts.</p>

			<h2>Then, deep learning</h2>
			<p>Actually, struggling or confluently that seems to be correlate of troubled times when a unifyed system of science and or the field theory, as it was set up afterwards, and the gestalt approach so passionate has submitted to since, was in construction. We indeed can find out there some papers which proves that professor F. Perls knew about the A. Whitehead's work, the pioneer author whose inputs, rescued or reinvented as soon as physic has achieved its right moment, might help physicists to deal with the phenomenological principle, as A. Shimony call it in a known discussion with R. Penrose. Though, in proper context, within, in turns, a phenomenological work environment. Here it does make sense the fact that the gestalt's main framework had been so interested in the how-tos ---approaching its phenomenological issues--- rather than compounding a theory on psychic. <br> So, do shall we have a deep look to these texts an you will see what so smoothly both ends, the gestalt panpsychism and that ultimate physic biology that happens could explain also consciousness, fits each other. </p>
